This is a direct fork from Face-Detection-JavaScript which is written by Kyle. 

When he wrote the original code, browsers let web application to upload contents directly from local files.

But it seems that now it is not allowd. 

For that I write a small project based on node.js (version 14) to act as a local server to upload necessary contents from localhost rather that local file system.
In this way it starts working as expected.
